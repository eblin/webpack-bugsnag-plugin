## BugsnagSourceMapPlugin

Check out https://docs.bugsnag.com/api/js-source-map-upload/ for more information about uploading sourcemaps to Bugsnag.

The `BugsnagSourceMapPlugin` plugin automatically uploads your bundle sourcemaps to Bugsnag, so when errors occur within your application you see the original source code right within your Bugsnag dashboard.
